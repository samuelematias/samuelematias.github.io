Hey, Iâ€™m [Samuel Matias](https://www.samuelematias.com/), and you've stumbled upon my braindump.

This website contains my articles, notes, food recipes, summing up, everything I think is worth to be sharing.

You can start checking out the [index](/notes/) with everything I wrote so far.

Have fun!
